                <h1>Adiyogi - The Source of Yoga</h1>
                <small>Tejeswar Reddy</small>
                <p>Over 15,000 years ago, predating all religion, Adiyogi, the first Yogi, transmitted the science of
                    Yoga to his seven disciples, the Saptarishis. He expounded 112 ways through which human beings can
                    transcend their limitations and reach their ultimate potential. Adiyogi’s offerings are tools for
                    individual transformation, as individual transformation is the only way to transform the world. His
                    fundamental message is that “in is the only way out” for human wellbeing and liberation.</p>
                <h2>Adiyogi is here to liberate you from disease, discomfort, and poverty – above all, from the very process of life and death. - Sadhguru</h2>

                <p>On the auspicious night of Mahashivaratri at Isha Yoga Center, an iconic face of “Adiyogi – the
                    Source of Yoga” was unveiled by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Recognized as the world's
                    largest bust sculpture by the Guinness World Records, the face of Adiyogi is 112 feet high,
                    representing the 112 ways he offered for one to attain to wellbeing and one's Ultimate nature.
                    Installed near the Adiyogi is the Yogeshwar Linga, which was consecrated by Sadhguru, as
                    manifestation of five of the major chakras in the human system. Adiyogi, with the presence of the
                    Yogeshwar Linga, has become a living entity.</p>
